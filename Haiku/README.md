# Haiku

## How I did this project

For this project, I first used [this website](https://reedsy.com/discovery/blog/haiku-poem-examples) to find a haiku. I picked number 32. Then, I used the cd command and dragged my haiku file from github that way the terminal can put me inside that file. Then I did the command `pwd` just to check that it was the right place. Then I put in the command ` say "A raindrop from, the roof, fell in my beer" -o haiku_audio.aiff ` to make the audio file. Once I check my files and see that it was successfully created, I push/commit my changes and clicked push orgin on github desktop. Then I opened this markdown file and started typing what I did.

## Debugging

There wasn't really anything much to debug. I just followed the steps we did in class.
