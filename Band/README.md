#### Problems faced, decisions made (as in other weeks)

There wasn't really any problems while coding the css file but I was just really indecisive about how I wanted things to look. I was going to make all the text have a pink background but it ended up looking too bulky and I got rid of all of that. Then I decided that I was just going to do a background and have everything just centered. For the centering I read about css flexbox and that's what I used to center all of the sections. For the background, I found [this website](https://css-tricks.com/stripes-css/) which made striped lines by slanting the lines by 45 degrees. But I wanted it to be a grid/skirt pattern so I did 2 of them crossed against eachother. Then I found out about [repeating-linear-gradent function](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_repeating-linear-gradient.php)and used that instead. I found all the rgb and hex codes just with the [google color picker](https://share.google/16iJITZuYI19jYCLu)

#### A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group

I created the css file for the website and made sure that everything worked with the HTML file that I recived from Danny. I mainly just patched up some things in the HTML file and made sure that everything actually showed the way I wanted it to. I started by looking at pictures of emo myspace pages and got a color pallet that I wanted to use. I also tried to find a cool font but in the end I just stuck with Ariel because the myspace pages all had that default font look. Then I just centered everything with flex box and made the background.

#### Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made
