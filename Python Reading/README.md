## Python Reading

Chapter 1:

One thing I knew and saw before was the print('Hello, World!') and the basic arithmetic in python. And we also talked about the differnet value types in class when covering other languages such as javascript. One thing I didn't know was about formal and natural languages. I didn't know that there were these classifications however I do notice that compared to python, javascript and other languages we covered are not as easy to read and understand if you don't already know the syntax.

Chapter 3:

One thing I knew was about importing modules to use built in libraries that contain pre made functions. One thing I didn't know was about fruitful and void functions. It makes sense that when you call a function you would usually always do something with it. I was wondering why someone would use a void function, or is it just something we have to be careful and avoid when coding?

Chapter 5:

I feel like most of the things this chapter talks about I already know of since we talked about these ideas in class when learning javascript, for example: modulus, boolean expressions, logical operators, conditional statements (if), Alternative execution (else), Chained conditionals (else if), nested conditionals, recursion, and even infinite recursion. One thing that was new to me was the keyboard input section where python has a built in function called input which can look for the user to type something and also save the response for later.
