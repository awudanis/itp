### CHAPTER 1

- One thing I didn't know was empty values. In this week's code along, I remember using the NULL value to delete raymond who didn't have a muchness value but I didn't really know what it meant.

- One thing I was already aware of is that there are different types of values like strings, numbers (positive/negative whole values) and floats. We also talked Boolean values/logic.

### CHAPTER 2

- There were a lot of things that were new to me in chapter 2. This chapter talked a lot about the syntax of coding and I don't know anything about that at all. It is very interesting that even spaces and indentation, things that I usually use to make things look more asthetic on word documents, are used almost like another function to tell the computer what we are trying to do.

- One thing that was familar to me was bindings. In this week's code along we binded people's names to an id that contained numerical values and whether they are scared of the dark or not, to a string value.

### CHAPTER 3

- In this chapter there were also a lot of things that I've never heard about before. For example, I have never heard of growing functions. It seems like they just keep on going until a certain condition is filled. In my mind, loops are indefinate or at least repeated with set number of times.

- One thing I am slightly familiar with is scope. We talked about this briefly in class and explained that scope is basically the background the computer is given in a situation. For example, a global scope would be something that is accepted throughout the whole project and if something is local, its like when we talked about giving the computer context for a certain situation and does not always apply in the whole project.
